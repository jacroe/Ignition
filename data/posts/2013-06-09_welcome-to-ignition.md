Hi. Congratulations on setting up Ignition. I understand that all you basically have done so far is upload a couple files to a server, but that is literally how easy Ignition is to start.

The default output is valid [HTML5](http://validator.w3.org/check/referer), [CSS3](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer), and RSS.

To edit some of the basic settings like the title and subtitle of your blog, edit the main Ignition file. Those variables should be the first few lines.

The RSS feed can be accessed by adding `?p=feed` to the end of the main Ignition file.

Ignition is licensed under the GPLv3 so you can do whatever the heck you want. Tear it up, adapt it, add to it; I don't care.

And now you've been Ignited.
